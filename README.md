## About the Video Course
The instructor will walk you through the exact process he does every week to discover new coins that might provide incredible gains in the future. There are a number of strategies, websites and methods presented in this course that you can leverage when doing your own research on potentially great cryptocurrency investments in the future. This course is for someone who already owns cryptocurrency, or may have just finished one of our beginners courses on investing in cryptocurrency. It can take a very long time to research and analyze all of the information available, for the over 1500 cryptocurrencies and ICO’s. The goal of this course is to save you time by sharing with you the author's methods and strategies so that you have a better understanding of what makes a coin valuable, how to figure out if it’s too late to invest in a coin, how to spot if certain coins may be a scam, or if they might not be worth much in the future. Investing in the bigger cryptocurrencies that have proven to stand the test of time works, but there's far more potential in undervalued coins? We’ll explore why that is so that you have a much better grasp of the entire cryptocurrency market and why it can be very beneficial to invest in undervalued coins.
